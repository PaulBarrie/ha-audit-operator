# HA Audit operator

This operator allows you to audit your HA cluster for issues and report them as Prometheus metrics.

## Description
Before launching the operator you need to make sure the targets you aim to provide in the CRD actually match the targets 
you want to perform HA Audit. If you just want to test before, you can find in this
[repository](https://github.com/PaulBarrie/ha-operator-test) an helm chart that will install dependent components 
and the Prometheus Stack.

You will be then able to create a CRD and see the metrics in the Prometheus UI. You will find an example of the CRD in 
the `config/samples` folder. Please follow the *Running on the cluster* section for more details.

## Getting Started
Youâ€™ll need a Kubernetes cluster to run against. You can use [KIND](https://sigs.k8s.io/kind) to get a local cluster for testing, or run against a remote cluster.
**Note:** Your controller will automatically use the current context in your kubeconfig file (i.e. whatever cluster `kubectl cluster-info` shows).

### Running on the cluster
Install cert manager:
```sh
    kubectl apply -f https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager/releases/download/v1.10.1/cert-manager.yaml
```

1. Install Instances of Custom Resources:

```sh
kubectl apply -f config/samples/
```

2. Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`:
	
```sh
make docker-build docker-push IMG=paulb314/ha-audit-operator:1.0.0
```
	
3. Deploy the controller to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make deploy IMG=paulb314/ha-audit-operator:1.0.0
```

### Uninstall CRDs
To delete the CRDs from the cluster:

```sh
make uninstall
```

### Undeploy controller
UnDeploy the controller to the cluster:

```sh
make undeploy
```

### How it works
This project aims to follow the Kubernetes [Operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/)

It uses [Controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/) 
which provides a reconcile function responsible for synchronizing resources untile the desired state is reached on the cluster 

### Test It Out
1. Install the CRDs into the cluster:

```sh
make install
```

2. Run your controller (this will run in the foreground, so switch to a new terminal if you want to leave it running):

```sh
make run
```

**NOTE:** You can also run this in one step by running: `make install run`

3. Test metric endpoints:
```sh

```
### Modifying the API definitions
If you are editing the API definitions, generate the manifests such as CRs or CRDs using:

```sh
make manifests
```

**NOTE:** Run `make --help` for more information on all potential `make` targets
